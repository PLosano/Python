# Variables

# They are used to contain information 

# Numercial Variables
# Integers, which correspond to the set of positive or negative integers (1, 2, 0, 123, -3, etc.)
account = 10
# Decimals, which, in addition to integers, include all decimal numbers (2.50, 5.99, -1.20)
length = 1876.79
width = 870.0

# It is important to keep in mind how the different numeric types can be mixed together and what the potential consequences are. If you mix different types, the most complex will be the one kept for the final result.

a = 7.5
b = 3
c = a/b
print(c)
# this will print 2.5, which is a float

a = 10
b = 5
c = a/b
print(c)
# it's a float

# you can force the conversion of a variable into a well-defined type

a = 14.0
# a is a float
a = int(a)
print(a)
# a is now an integer: it prints 14 and not 14.0

#Character Strings
city = 'New York'
film = 'taxi driver'
emptyString = ''

favoriteCityOne = "San Francisco"
favoriteCityTwo = "New York"
favorites = favoriteCityOne + favoriteCityTwo
print(favorites) # => "San FranciscoNew York"

favoriteCityOne = "San Francisco"
favoriteCityTwo = "New York"
favorites = "My favorite cities are " + favoriteCityOne + " and "+ favoriteCityTwo
print(favorites) # -> "My favorite cities are San Francisco and New York"

city = "Sydney"
numberTrips = 5
history = "I've been to " + city + " " + str(numberTrips) + " times "
print(history) # => "I've been to Sydney 5 times"

#Functions 
# Functions can group several statements in a block which will be called using a name. 
# Main purpose reuse a portion of code already written just by stating the function name 

# Examples
# len() :  a function that returns the length of an item. Do you remember strings? Using this function on a string tells you how many characters the string contains. 
# type() : lets you print the type of a variable.
# pow(a, b) : lets you calculate a to the power of b. It is equivalent to writing a**b.
# abs() :  returns the absolute value of a number.

a = "apple"
print(len(a))
print(type(a))
print(pow(4,2))
print(abs(-100))

#Write a function

def printPerimeter():
    dimension1 = 6
    dimension2 = 4
    dimension3 = 3
    perimeter = dimension1 + dimension2 + dimension3
    print(perimeter)

printPerimeter() # => 13

#Parameters 
# To overcome this limitation, you must make your function accept external numbers. You can do this by defining parameters.

def printPerimeter(dimension1, dimension2, dimension3):
    perimeter = dimension1 + dimension2 + dimension3
    print(perimeter)

printPerimeter(10, 11, 4) # => 25
printPerimeter(2, 2, 3.5) # => 7.5

# Parameters are variables declared in a function. The values that are passed as parameters are called arguments.

# Often, when you use a function in a code, you expect an answer that you can reuse to move forward in the code. This answer can be provided via the value returned by a function.

#Define a Return Value

def calculatePerimeter(dimension1, dimension2, dimension3):
    perimeter = dimension1 + dimension2 + dimension3
    return perimeter

perimeter1 = calculatePerimeter(6, 4, 3)
perimeter2 = calculatePerimeter(10, 3, 11)

print("The perimeter of my first triangle is", perimeter1, "and that of my second is", perimeter2)

#Class & Objects

# In programming, this concept of a group or category of objects is called a class.
# A class can be considered as the construction diagram for an object that will define the characteristics of all objects of this type and their features.
# Let's take a concrete example with a Car class. The plan of a car can be defined by:
# its characteristics, called attributes: it must have four wheels, a color, a shape, an engine power, etc.
# its functionalities, called methods: it can drive, brake, etc.

var1 = 14
var2 = 1031

# In reality, you have created two instances of the int class, two objects each with a single attribute: its value. The same is true for floats or strings: every time you create a variable of one of these types, you are actually creating objects in Python with the value you assign to them as an attribute.
# The use of a method is always done via the   variableName.method()  notation. For example, strings have a method called   lower()  which will transform all the text contained in an object into lower case. 

a = "HELLO WORLD!"
a.lower()

#String Methods 
#upper() :  returns the whole text in upper case.
#capitalize() :  returns the whole text in lowercase with the first letter capitalized.
#replace(old, new) :  this method takes two arguments: old and new, both of which are strings.  The method returns the original string with all occurrences of old replaced with new. 
#find(string)  returns either the index of the first occurrence of the string passed in the  argument, or -1 if it does not find it.

text = "here os an EXAMPLE of a STRING"
a = text.upper()
print(a)
print(text.capitalize())
print(text.replace('EXAMPLE', "test"))
print(text.find('an'))
print(text.find('two'))

b = "This is A TEST"
print(b.capitalize())

a = 4 

def polynomial (a, b, c, x):
        return a*x**2 + b*x + c 
b = a 
b *= a
c = 1 
resul = polynomial(a, b, c, 0)
a +=3 
a = 0

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

#Lists 
# Declare a List to Store Your Items

#Lists are objects that can contain a collection of objects of any type.  We can have a list containing several integers (1, 2, 50, 2,000 or more, it doesn't matter), a list containing floats, a list containing strings, or even a list mixing objects of different types.
#Lists are ordered objects - This number is called an index and it starts at 0 (not 1!). 

customerName = ['Marion Weaver', 'Alberto Mendoza', 'Katharine Tyler', 'IsaacÂ Steele']

# assign the value 'Marianne Weaver' to the first name in our list
# it is index 0, because indices start at 0 in python!
customerName[0] = 'Marianne Weaver'
print(customerName[0])


#Python also lets you use negative indices to access or modify an item. The index -1 corresponds to the last item of the list, -2 to the second last, and so on. You can also access an index range by using the  :  operator. For example, 1:3 will let you access items two to four.
# print the last item
print(customerName[-1])

# access the second item to the 3rd
print(customerName[1:3])

# access all items from the beginning to the second
print(customerName[:2])

strangeList = [4, 10.2, 'Marion Weaver', ['another list', 1]]

# print the 4th item of the list
print(strangeList[3])

#Thanks to the different list methods, we can:

#search for a specific item in the list.
#add a new item at the end.
#insert a new item at a specific index.
#delete an item from the list.

list = []
list.append(7)
list.append(5)
print(list) # => [7, 5]

list = []
list.append(7) # -> [7]
list.append(5) # -> [7, 5]
list.insert(1,12) # [7, 12, 5]
list[0] = 4 # -> [4, 12, 5]
list.remove(12) # [4, 5]
list.index(5) # prints 1
list.extend([1, 2, 3]) # [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
del list[3] # [4, 5, 1, 3]

# The   len()  function lets you retrieve the size of your list:
list = [1, 2, 3]
len(list) # will print 3

#Dictionaries
# Dictionaries are another type of object, similar to lists, but which will let you do this with a single variable! Indeed, a dictionary is a list of items organized via a system of keys. With a real dictionary, you look up a word to access its definition. In programming, this word corresponds to the key and the definition to the value associated with it. This is called a key-value pair. 
# Each key in a dictionary must be unique. Strings are generally used to define keys, but this is not a requirement, per se.

accounts = {'Marion Weaver': 10000, 'Alberto Mendoza': 150, 'Katharine Tyler': 300, 'Isaac Steele': 1800.74}
print(accounts['Alberto Mendoza']) # -> 150

#Here are the operations frequently carried out with dictionaries:
#Access the value of an item
#Add a new item (a new key-value pair)
#Delete an item via its key

accounts['Marion Weaver'] -= 2000 # I subtract 2000 from David's account
accounts['Kristian Roach'] = 1000 # I add a new individual in my dictionary
print(accounts['Kristian Roach']) # I print the value of Kristian's account

accounts.pop('Alberto Mendoza') # deletes Alberto Mendoza from our dictionary

#Len can be use to 
len(accounts) # -> 3

#Tuples

#The last type of collection we will look at are tuples. These are very similar to lists:
#They are ordered objects, so we can access the different items stored in a tuple from their index.
#You can store any kind of object in a tuple.
#The main difference is that once a tuple has been declared, it cannot be modified. It is then said that it is immutable.

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b')

print(my_tuple[1]) # -> 2
print(my_tuple[4]) # -> 'b'

a, b = (1, 'apple')
print(a) # -> 1
print(b) # -> 'apple'
